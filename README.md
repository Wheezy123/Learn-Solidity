# Learn-Solidity

Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. It was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.


This is a playground where I'll experiment with different aspects of Solidity, the Ethereum network, and smart contract development
